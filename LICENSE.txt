This end user Licence Agreement (hereinafter “Agreement”) is a legal agreement
between you, or, if you represent a legal entity, that legal entity (hereinafter
“you”) and FSI FontShop International GmbH (hereinafter “FSI”), and is
applicable to the Font Software that is accompanied by this Agreement or that
you have ordered online.

By downloading the Font Software or opening the package, you agree to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this
Agreement, do not download, install, or use the Font Software. If you have
purchased a Licence to use the Font Software in a sealed retail package and do

purchase.

1. Definitions

“Font Software” means coded software that generates typeface designs when used
“with the appropriate hard- and software plus any and all other data including
“documentation provided with such software.

“Licensed Unit” means an installation of the Font Software that allows up to
“five (5) concurrent users to use it at a single geographic location. A single
“geographic location is in particular the site of your place of business. The
“geographic restriction does not apply to portable computers if they are owned
“by you.

2. Grant of License

2.1. Number of users. FSI grants you a non-exclusive licence to use the Font
Software in a Licensed Unit for your own personal or business purposes according
to the terms of this Agreement. If the number of users who use the Font Software
exceeds those set forth in the definition of Licensed Unit above, then you must
request from FSI or its authorized Distributors an appropriate licence covering
all users. An additional fee will be charged for this licence extension.

2.2. Embedding. You may embed the Font Software in documents, applications or
devices either as a rasterized representation of the Font Software (e. g., a GIF
or JPEG) or as a subset of the Font Software as long as the document,
application or device is distributed in a secure format that permits only the
viewing and printing but not the editing of the text. You need an additional
licence from FSI or its Distributors (i) for the use of the Font Software in
documents, applications or devices permitting editing of the text, if such
documents, applications or devices shall be distributed to third parties or (ii)
if the Font Software is embedded neither as a subset nor as a rasterized
representation.

2.3. Back-up. You may make back-up copies of the Font Software for archival
purposes only, provided that you retain exclusive custody and control over such
copies.

2.4. Service bureaus. You may take a digitized copy of the Font Software used in
a particular document to a commercial printer or service bureau for outputting
this particular document (this document must not be edited by the printer or
service bureau). In the event of any modifications to the document or use of the
Font Software for other purposes, the printer or service bureau must purchase
its own Font Software licences.

2.5. Copying. Except as granted in 2.2. to 2.4., you may not copy the Font
Software or allow third parties to copy the Font Software. Any copy of the Font
Software must contain the same copyright, trademark, and other proprietary
information as the originals.

2.6. Modifications. Except as granted in 2.2., you may not modify, adapt,
translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or attempt to
discover the source code of the Font Software. If you want to make modifications
to the Font Software, you must obtain the prior written consent of FSI.

3. Ownership

The Font Software, and all copies thereof, is protected by the United States
Copyright Law, by the copyright and design laws of other nations, and by
international treaties. Any copyright, trademark and other rights belong
exclusively to FSI, except as expressly provided in 2.1. You do not gain the
ownership of the Font Software under this Agreement. The structure,
organization, and the code of the Font Software are trade secrets of FSI, and
you agree to treat them as such.

4. Transfer of License

Except as expressly provided herein, you may not give, rent or lease the Font
Software or parts of it to third parties. You may transfer all your rights to

provided that (i) the transferee accepts and agrees in writing (with copy to
FSI) to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) you
destroy all copies of the Font Software and Documentation, including all copies
stored in the memory of a hardware device. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, you agree that you will not distribute or disseminate all or any
part of the Font Software through any online service.

5. Warranties

FSI warrants to you that the Font Software will perform substantially in
accordance with the Documentation for the ninety (90) day period following your
receipt of the Font Software. To make a warranty claim, you must return the Font
Software to the location from which you obtained it along with a copy of your
sales receipt within such ninety (90) day period. If the Font Software does not
perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, the entire and
exclusive liability and remedy shall be limited to either, at FSI’s option, the
replacement of the Font Software or the refund of the licence fee you paid for
the Font Software. FSI and its suppliers do not and cannot warrant the
performance or results you may obtain by using the Font Software or
Documentation. The foregoing states the sole and exclusive remedies for FSI’s or
its suppliers’ breach of warranty. Except for the foregoing limited warranty,
FSI and its suppliers make no warranties express or implied, as to non-
infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or fitness for any
particular purpose. In no event will FSI or its suppliers be liable to you for
any consequential, incidental or special damages, including any lost profits or
lost savings, even if a FSI representative has been advised of the possibility
of such damages, or for any claim by any third party. This warranty does not
affect any claims you might have against your retailer.

6. Governing Law

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of Germany. This agreement will not
be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If any part of
this agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity
of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable
according to its terms. You agree that the Font Software will not be shipped,
transferred or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the
United States Export Administration Act or any other applicable export laws,
restrictions or regulations. This Agreement may only be modified in writing
signed by an authorized officer of FSI.
